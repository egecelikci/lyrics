“Mach-Hommy”
“What is it, Mach-Hommy?”
“Yeah”
“Yeah?”
“What is it?”
“Mach-Hommy”

The room was heavy with ping and pong
Signifying monkey niggas thought they was in their dominion
Cold chilling, then I step inside the dive, kill the vibe
Then they dominion mine
What he do when no feeling, when they want him to die? Cry?
Uh, though nothing jerk tears like separation
When what you learn don’t matter, what you heard
If it’s what you hold dear, end up disintegrating
Even if it’s instantaneous or if it’s in phases
Places, places, places everyone
You niggas over there in the different a-bus
I don’t think you can rent that
Bet that, if it’s yourn my nigga double down
If it’s porn then stop hand cuffing and brawl nigga, fuck around
Nigga doggies be liking doggy treats
Heard you brought them bum bitch a bathrobe
Heard you was rubbing on them ugly feet

I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, I keep my feelings to my self
I don’t feel the hurt
I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, back you down in the paint, work
Knock you off your pivot, jerk
I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, I keep my feelings to my self
I don’t feel the hurt
I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, back you down in the paint, work
Knock you off your pivot, jerk

C.C. my negro Covito yer
Them boys was heated up doogy, juvy two tea and ter
All too familiar with different demons
Still see them on passing, on occasion
I nod a smirk, they know the reasons
Blow drip hit the throat like an Neti pot
Niggas said he sought to dethrone my kingly spot but I bet he not
You end up waiting with the nature, boy and your leg is locked
You can’t breach the ropes
From Hip-Hop and out the tav then walk
But I add, we the best you niggas got
Yeah, we in the spot blessed my niggas like EGOT winners
No John Legend we ain’t ordinary people
We cut from some other cloths
These materials you not used to seeing
Your diplomats selling your plot on a map for a flipping watch
Mermaids exchanging voices for a hotter twat
Dirty destiny ’dis nigga ’dis hoe
Diss me you dissing yourself so just know

No I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, keep my feelings to my self
I don’t feel the hurt
I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, back you down in the paint, work
Knock you off your pivot, jerk
I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, I keep my feelings to my self
I don’t feel the hurt
I don’t have feelings sir
Sir, back you down in the paint, work
Knock you off your pivot, jerk
