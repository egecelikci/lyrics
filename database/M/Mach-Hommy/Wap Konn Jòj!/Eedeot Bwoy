Yeah
Kick that shit son

Aight, check it Nike box filled with ammo and money
Heavy metal with me so I can handle what’s coming
Beat the mic up the booth can’t handle the drumming
Lift the pipe up, destruction was us from dumping
God bless, steady working barely get rest 
Never fumble keep the ball close to the chest
You playing checkers while the wise ones play chess
I move in silence so I choose to say less
Uh, magazine filled with demon killers
Guess I gotta slay a devil say and mean it nigga
I’m well alert, knowing that the snake’s watching
Niggas turning on their fam’ that’s the snake option

(Would you do such a thing?)
(DUMPGAWD)

Right Give it up
Yo, most of the world’s wearing a costume
Ain’t been pure since they were up in Ma’s womb
A long time right?
First couple years we rolled factor
Word to Momma likes the drama, and everybody’s just an actor
Pause, the hardest thug of them all is a fraud
Cause he tricked himself hella mobster is a bigger phony
Imposter with all that fallen ye’s pasta rigatoni
They treacherous do your dirt by your lonely
But don’t be going in the shop when you get you wet you up
Your own man has set you up for the cash grab
Can’t wait to see you buckle
I want the last laugh y’all can have the chuckles
Sucker playing both sides like he switch hitting
Should’ve come no surprise when they change up
Circus peanut IQ’s even the nerds and the smarties 
Probably smack somebody if I go out
So I play the house like dance parties
Never answering the door when the bell ring
That’s a drag bring me a different kinda bag getting money
I ain’t talking ’bout porn you can keep the candy corn
You heard? 

Uh huh, woah way back when P&P tried to smoke by
I was just a twinkle in my Mom duke’s eye
You cowards chose sides
No prob, just take the first step and fake
You ain’t gotta see the whole staircase to get away
I keep it Lo-Fi, won’t be my first ever state
Say, say gold digging bitches be chasing phantoms
Niggas cramming up in the little G-Wagon
With the lamest agenda
You ain’t never have a way with the women
Tap your jaw just like LeBron slap talcum,
Splash mountain adderall I have em all bad mouth and bag
Shouting like Alex Jones
Niggas said they want war but they information old
She a bag of bones
She used to be mad thick we was packing pole back and forth 
Shooting mad shit when he was back at home
Flip you like wet yola Who knew 
Thanksgiving turkey soup you was food 
Them niggas left overs I’m unstoppable, it’s palpable 
Even if you wasn’t there, it’s in the air my nigga
