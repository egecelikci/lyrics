Those times you gotta pay
Sometimes you gotta break
Used to do the one-a-days

And now I sip ’em by the case
Keep my nose from out the vapors I was sniffin’ in the day
Niggas rearrange
Same thing built is the same
I don’t face shock, I sit in the same spot
Stealin’ my ways like you still in my wave, guy
I don’t face shock, I sit in the same spot
Stealin’ my ways like you still in my wave (Wave, wave)

Aye, aye 
Shoot the pompadour off a little daddy head, magic spray
Concentrated pockets like icing on strudel when a ratty spin
I bet somebody better call Scotland Yard
My nigga Hommy’s swinging poles out the car
Pusillanimous caricatures, hammer just blam at ya
Collobrators sammiches
Niggas eat food around here, no amateurs
Niggas keep it hood around here, most savages
Niggas be to kill a nigga, see the law averages
See the crystal ball, all the bleedin’ on the canvases?
See the vision, dawg? You ain’t even on my planet ye
How you even armed? You ain’t even on the premises

We don’t ever see you in the jawn, you a lyricist
We don’t ever see you in the jawn, you a lyricist
We don’t ever see you in the jawn, you a lyricist
We don’t ever see you in the jawn, you a lyricist
Yeah, yeah
