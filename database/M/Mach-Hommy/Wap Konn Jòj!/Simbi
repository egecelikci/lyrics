“How long you think it takes to get famous?”
“For a musician or a painter?”
“Whatever, famous”
“4 Years, 6 to get rich, first your gonna have dress right y’know
Then your gonna have to hang out with famous people, y’know
Make friends with the right blonde people
Go to the right parties yeah? Social life
Then you gotta do your work all the time
And your not doing that
But I’m talking about the same kinda work
The same style so people can recognize you
And don’t get confused y’know
Then once you’re famous, air born y’know
You gotta keep doing it in the same way
Even after it’s boring
Well unless you want people to really mad at you
They will anyway”

Uh, no shenanigans just all bubble and squeak
If you never pour no custard in your ramekins
You don’t fuck with your Jeep, peace
How many merry-go-rounds you make?
How much … and … how many options
How much bottles of stoppers on the tape
Flip you like a dust bin lid
I’d be … the other way until the rattle and klink
You living on rations I imagine
And I don’t fuck with kids
niggas is bums and licks, bitch
Hop the fuck up off my artist
We mobbing, shit might trade this
… rich
Rich niggas better call Saul, word is bond, I’m on some raw shit (brr, shit)
Let her show me …
niggas know me for getting busy
I’m in your city, is you in your city I don’t fear me
Hear me we don’t miss
What’s the Kima, Keisha, and Pam nigga
What’s the total amount of of niggas believing
And can we stand niggas?
True north is absolute zero
Move on, you have to move if you don’t have a clue what to do
Here go, eat a dick, sprinkle some AIDS on it
You ain’t even sick until you truly sick and people put names on it
Burn a nigga like …’s jail spoon
Bet he disappear like … careful
This is estuary English you know we flow you know we read it too
Midnight blue with a Cockney accent you only hear ‘mm’
